As the last assignment to finish the course, we had to choose an online dataset and apply the
concepts learned during the course.

## 1. Finding and choosing a dataset

To start with I was considering using either one related to sports (most likely the Champion's
League matches one) or one about e-sports (one about the MOBA DOTA2). However, I ended up choosing
this one: [](). The main reason was that I had previously used a similar one for a mobile app demo I
did ~1-2 years ago, so it was interesting to me.

## 2. Understanding the dataset

Understand and describe the modeling objective clearly: a. What type of data is it? (images, text,
audio etc.) b. What type of problem is it? (regression, classification, generative modeling, etc.)

## 3. Exploratory data analysis

explore the data by plotting graphs and answer any questions you may have

## 4. Modeling - try 4-5 approaches

a. Define a model (network architecture) b. Pick some hyperparameters c. Train the model d. Make
predictions on samples e. Evaluate on test dataset f. Save the model weights g. Record the metrics

## 5. Conclusions

Summarize your learning & identify opportunities for future work.
