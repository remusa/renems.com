For this assignment we had to use a dataset of everyday objects and classify it by training and
using a neural network.

## Steps

1. Explore the CIFAR10 dataset:
   [CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
2. Set up a training pipeline to train a neural network on a GPU (using Kaggle).
3. Experiment with different network architectures & hyperparameters.
