For this assignment we had to use personal information from a person to predict the price of medical
bills for a year.

## Steps

1. Download and explore the dataset.
2. Prepare the dataset for training.
3. Create a linear regression model.
4. Train the model to fit the data.
5. Make predictions using the trained model.
